# Apps

App management

'useApps' hook

# TODO

Which ones are useful and which ones aren't is up to you

- [x] Fetch apps
- [x] On another page
    - [x] Show running apps
    - [ ] Show apps that were run in the current session(pc)
- [ ] There should be like a context for every app state
- [x] Be able to group apps together

Mainly for 'good-roots' stack

## View

- [x] Show all apps
    - [x] Sort apps alphabetically
- [x] Show app terminal output
    - [x] Have terminal colors(This was hard for me because I didn't know how)

### App actions

- [x] Start app
- [x] [Stop app](./actions/Stop.md)

On the process tab I've made a view to check running processes, they can be stopped from there.

- [x] On app action trigger reload

Because the output is not updated
