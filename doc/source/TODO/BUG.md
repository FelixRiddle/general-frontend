- [ ] Can't run two different apps(Only for sockets).

2024/05/16: I can't deal with this error now, it's so intrinsic I have no clue where it is.

- [x] Am able to run two different apps without sockets.

- [ ] Can't get output of apps that use any of these:

* 'concurrently' package
* Any nextjs app
