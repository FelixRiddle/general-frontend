# Group apps

- [x] Like my 'good-roots' stack for example

Group apps together and run them all with a click.

## Run group of apps

There are many ways to implement this, these are two ideas that I thought, one is to simply run the scripts with a specific name and the other are custom scripts / commands organization.

### Run scripts by name

This is to run scripts that are named, like 'npm run test', 'npm run dev', 'npm run start' etc...

- [x] Run scripts by name
- [ ] Notify if an app of the group doesn't have that script name

- [ ] Run app on release mode

This will run first the 'build' script if it exists and then will run the 'start' script.

### Run custom scripts

<!-- Maybe not necessary, it's easier to have a fixed script name on every app and just use that -->

- [ ] Run custom scripts
